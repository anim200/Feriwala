## CUET FERIWALA

**CUET FERIWALA** primarily operates on a client-to-client (C2C) or consumer-to-consumer model. Here, users can sell different categories of products, and buyers can purchase them by contacting the sellers through chat.

Users can post their products or services on the site, and potential buyers can browse these posts and contact the sellers directly to negotiate prices, ask questions, etc.

There is also an admin dashboard to control the site.
